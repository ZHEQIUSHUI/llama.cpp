# Axera NPU Backend for llama.cpp

> [!NOTE]
> Early stage: only the matrix products of BF16 GGUF models run on the NPU so far; every other op falls back to the
> CPU backend. On an AX8860 board, Qwen3.5-0.8B BF16 generates the same text as the CPU backend at 101 ms per token

The Axera backend ([`ggml/src/ggml-axera`](../../ggml/src/ggml-axera)) runs GGML ops on the NPU of Axera SoCs (AX8860)
with precompiled kernels, and leaves everything else to the CPU backend.

- **Memory**: tensors of offloaded layers live in CMM (the SoC's physically contiguous memory). CMM is mapped into the
  process, so the CPU backend reads and writes the same buffers without copies; the NPU addresses them physically.
- **Kernels**: AXDSL programs compiled offline into `.axmodel` files. Weights are runtime inputs, so one kernel serves
  every tensor of the same shape and GGUF weights are used as they are. The backend looks kernels up by name in
  `GGML_AXERA_KERNEL_DIR` (default `./axera_kernels`) and only claims an op if its kernel exists.
- **Cores**: kernels are single-core. The current NPU driver neither synchronizes cores reliably inside a task nor runs
  tasks on different cores concurrently.

## Supported ops

| Op | Condition | Kernel |
|---|---|---|
| `MUL_MAT` | BF16 weights in CMM, F32 activations | `mul_mat_bf16_n<C>_k<K>.axmodel`: inputs `x` [1, K] bf16, `w` [C, K] bf16; output `out` [1, C] f32 |

`C` is the weight row count `N` itself, or the largest available `C` that divides `N`: a vocabulary-sized output
projection runs as `N / C` calls. Several activation rows (prompt processing) run row by row and reread the weights
each time, until a batched kernel exists.

## Build

Cross-compile on an x86-64 host with the Arm GNU toolchain 13.2 (the BSP libraries need glibc 2.38) and the AX8860
BSP (`include/ax_engine_api.h`, `lib/libax_engine.so`, ...):

```bash
T=<arm-gnu-toolchain-13.2.Rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu>/bin
cmake -S . -B build-axera \
    -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Linux -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=aarch64 \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$T/aarch64-none-linux-gnu-gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$T/aarch64-none-linux-gnu-g++ \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF -DGGML_CPU_ARM_ARCH=armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16 \
    -DGGML_OPENMP=OFF -DLLAMA_CURL=OFF -DLLAMA_OPENSSL=OFF \
    -DGGML_AXERA=ON -DGGML_AXERA_BSP_DIR=<bsp>/arm64_glibc
cmake --build build-axera -j --target llama-cli llama-completion llama-bench test-backend-ops
```

## Run

On the board, with the BSP runtime libraries on the library path and the kernels for the model's weight shapes:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib:$PWD/build-axera/bin
export GGML_AXERA_KERNEL_DIR=$PWD/axera_kernels
./build-axera/bin/llama-completion -m qwen3.5-0.8b-bf16.gguf -ngl 99 -p "The capital of France is" -n 32
```

`-ngl` places the layers' weights in CMM, which the NPU needs. `GGML_AXERA_DEBUG=1` logs every op shape whose kernel is
missing, i.e. the kernels to compile next.

## Kernels

The kernels are generated from the GGUF itself: every BF16 2-D weight shape gets one GEMV kernel (in chunks for
vocabulary-sized shapes), checked on the NPU simulator against PyTorch. The generator needs the Axera `axnn` toolchain and is kept with the AXDSL kernel sources,
outside this repository.
